An internet connection is required to update/download files.

Intended for Windows.

The infographic maker is case-sensitive.

Most style options have not been implemented yet. It is possible to add a frequency option in the config given that an icon for it exists (with the same filename, without whitespace)

# Quantity Numbers for Tokens
